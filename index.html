      <h2>Hey there!</h2>
      <p class="hey">I'm a beginner programmer located in Akaa, near the city of Tampere.
        I'm currently learning to code and am making a switch from being a translator and entrepreneur to a developer.
        I may only be at the beginning of my journey, but I am highly motivated and willing to put in a tremendous amount of
        time and effort to better myself and eventually become employed as a programmer.</p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>So far, I have experience with Java, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
          I am keen and very motivated to learn more
          about these as well as other technologies employed in the programming industry. I am in the middle of the Udemy course
          <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">"The Complete Web Development Bootcamp"</a> by Angela Yu.
          I also have plans to study courses in JavaScript and Python. Please, have a look at <a href="portfolio.html"> my portfolio</a>
          for some of the projects I have been working on.</p>

        <h3>Other skills</h3>
        <p>I have spent the last 15 years working as an entrepreneur in the translation industry. I also have an MA in translation science.
          This has given me a pretty unique skillset. I am able to work and make decisions independently, cooperate with a wide variety of different people, as well as handle deadlines and clients.
          On top of these are of course my language skills: I am proficient in Finnish, English and German.
